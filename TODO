   TO DO
   -----

  * Handle changes to OPTIONS by keeping track of the contents of
    /var/db/ports. DONE

  * Store a 'last modified' date per port/category entry in the
    cache.  Makes handling the OPTIONS stuff feasible. DONE

  * Strict mode: Allow only the ports that are hooked up to the Makefile
    in the tree, plus enforce output changes to make what we produce as
    identical to 'make index' as possible. DONE

  * Use multiple workers to gather port dependency data.  This should
    result in a cache-init that is faster than 'make index' on the
    right hardware.

  * Roll our own 'serialization' of the perl objects to be stored in
    the cache.  Data should be stored in a format accessible from
    various different languages, not just Perl. DONE (and the whole
    package no longer depends on Storable.pm)

  * Clean up the way errors and warnings are presented -- messages at
    the moment contain too much extraneous stuff.  Also tie what is
    produced into the 'quiet' vs. 'verbose' options better.  (Multiple
    levels of verbosity?) DONE

  * Add a find-updated mode checking against the timestamps recorded
    in the cache.

  * Process portsnap output. DONE

  * Record whether any differences were discovered during checking (?).

  * RDBMS back-end rather than single BDB file for datastore.  This should
    help with the multiple workers concept.

  * LIBRARY_DEPENDS -- store this data as returned from port Makefiles
    so that we have a handy way of knowing what ports need updating as a
    result of a shlib bump. DONE
