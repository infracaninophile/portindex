   TO DO
   -----

  * Handle changes to OPTIONS by keeping track of the contents of
    /var/db/ports

  * Strict mode: Allow only the ports that are hooked up to the Makefile
    in the tree, plus enforce output changes to make what we produce as
    identical to 'make index' as possible.

  * Use multiple workers to gather port dependency data.  This should
    result in a cache-init that is faster than 'make index' on the
    right hardware.

  * Roll our own 'serialization' of the perl objects to be stored in
    the cache.  Data should be stored in a format accessible from various
    different languages, not just Perl.
