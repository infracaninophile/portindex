        - Add MAKEFILE_LIST processing: do a cache update for a port
          when any included Makefile is updated

        - Add warnings about /etc/make.conf or
          /usr/ports/Mk/bsd.port.mk being more recently updated than
          the cache -- time to reinitialise the cache?

        - Document reasons for doing cache-init rather than
          cache-update

        - When run as root, only load the /usr/local/etc/portindex.cfg
          configuration file.
