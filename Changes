	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-X -A -v 1.0 -n FreeBSD::Portindex::Port

1.1  Fri Nov  5 14:32:00 2004

        - Add MAKEFILE_LIST processing: do a cache update for a port
          when any included Makefile is updated

        - Add warnings about /etc/make.conf or
          /usr/ports/Mk/bsd.port.mk being more recently updated than
          the cache -- time to reinitialise the cache?

        - Document reasons for doing cache-init rather than
          cache-update

        - When run as root, only load the /usr/local/etc/portindex.cfg
          configuration file.

	- Respect $PORTSDIR, add '-p' or '--ports-dir' option to
          select PortsDir to cache-update, cache-init and
          find-updated.  Change cache-update's '-p' (propagation
          delay) to '-P'.

        - Don't emit the cache-update warnings about /etc/make.conf
          etc. being updated when in quiet mode.

	- Add '--ubiquitous-makefiles' and '--endemic-makefiles'
          options: For cache-update, UbiquitousMakefiles contains the
          list of makefiles to check for updates and suggest that it
          is time for a new cache-init run.  '--endemic-makefiles' is
          a similar list, but they don't get any timestamp comparision
          -- the idea being that changes to the endemic makefiles
          wouldn't affect the final outcome.  Neither cache-init or
          cache-update will record any makefile from these lists in
          the cache as a trigger for re-checking any port.
