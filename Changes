Revision history for Perl extension FreeBSD::Portindex::Port.

1.0  Mon Nov  1 11:23:10 2004
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-X -A -v 1.0 -n FreeBSD::Portindex::Port

1.1  Fri Nov  5 14:32:00 2004

        - Add MAKEFILE_LIST processing: do a cache update for a port
          when any included Makefile is updated

        - Add warnings about /etc/make.conf or
          /usr/ports/Mk/bsd.port.mk being more recently updated than
          the cache -- time to reinitialise the cache?

        - Document reasons for doing cache-init rather than
          cache-update

        - When run as root, only load the /usr/local/etc/portindex.cfg
          configuration file.

1.2 Sun Jan 16 13:47:00 2005

	- Respect $PORTSDIR, add '-p' or '--ports-dir' option to
          select PortsDir to cache-update, cache-init and
          find-updated.  Change cache-update's '-p' (propagation
          delay) to '-P'.  Requested by Renato Botelho <renato (at)
          galle.com.br>

        - Don't emit the cache-update warnings about /etc/make.conf
          etc. being updated when in quiet mode.

	- Add '--ubiquitous-makefiles' and '--endemic-makefiles'
          options: For cache-update, UbiquitousMakefiles contains the
          list of makefiles to check for updates and suggest that it
          is time for a new cache-init run.  '--endemic-makefiles' is
          a similar list, but they don't get any timestamp comparision
          -- the idea being that changes to the endemic makefiles
          wouldn't affect the final outcome.  Neither cache-init or
          cache-update will record any makefile from these lists in
          the cache as a trigger for re-checking any port.

1.3 Fri Jan 21 21:55:00 2005

	- Fix dumb programming error that stopped cache-update's
          cvsup-checkouts mode working.

1.4 Sat Feb 19 10:35:00 2005

        - Allow cache-updates to process the output from cvsup(1)'s
          cvs mode, as well as checkout mode.  Patch from SANETO
          Takanori <sanewo (at) ba2.so-net.ne.jp>.

        - Fix a run-away recursion problem reported by Alaine <2a (at)
          deuza.net>

1.5 Sun Jan 29 13:52:30

        - Stop cache-init falling over while processing a category
          directory with no ports in it yet.  Bug reported by Will
          Wainwright <survive (at) masterrave.com>


1.6 Sun Jun 25 15:22:00 2006

        - Incorporate local ports/categories into the INDEX by
          scanning Makefile.local for additions to $SUBDIR.  Mentioned
          on freebsd-ports@freebsd.org by Rong-En Fan <rafan (at)
          infor.org>

        - Clean up error messages, and factor out common progress
          counter code.

        - Add a new Category object type, and cope better with changes
          to categories (ie. ports being hooked up / unhooked from the
          tree).  Problem pointed out by Colin Percival <cperciva (at)
          freebsd.org>

        - Instead of calling perl to compile exactly the same bit of
          perl code from /usr/ports/Mk/bsd.ports.mk about 15,000 times
          (ie once per port) as a consequence of actually running
          'make describe', just call perl once, use make to print out
          the basic variables from the port and replicate the
          processing done ourselves.

1.7 Tue Jul 18 19:45:00 2006

        - Following some useful e-mail discussions with Mark Linimon
          and Dan Langille, switch to using the MASTER_PORT variable
          to detect master/slave relationships between ports.
          MASTER_PORT will be set in every slave port whereas
          MASTERDIR doesn't have to be.  Here a slave port is one
          defined as using port metadata from some other port, and
          doesn't have to go as far as requiring both master and slave
          to use the same Makefile and other ports infrastructure.

1.7 Sat Jul 22 20:13:00 2006

        - Keep track of the version of the software used to create the
          cache, and prompt for a cache rebuild if the software has
          been upgraded since.  A cache rebuild is definitely required
          for the 1.6 -> 1.7 update.

1.7 Sun Jul 23 10:56:00 2006

        - Don't quit on errors parsing make variables at the cache-init
          or cache-update stage.  Print copious error messages, but carry
          on processing.  Entries for ports that fail at this stage will
          not be created in the cache.

1.8 Sun Sep 17 12:34:00 2006

        - In the spirit of always plugging on and generating the best
          INDEX file possible, catch port errors that lead to
          dependencies showing some random part of the filesystem as
          the port to install to fulfil themselves.  Instead of
          falling over, complain bitterly and omit the broken
          dependency from the output INDEX.
